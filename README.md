Simulated Machine Learning for Automotive ECU Tuning
Overview
This project is an open-source, web-based tool that leverages a custom GPT model created with OpenAI to provide advanced tuning advice and map enhancement for automotive Engine Control Units (ECUs). Automotive enthusiasts and professionals can use this tool online to optimize engine performance, fuel efficiency, and overall vehicle dynamics through intelligent, data-driven adjustments powered by state-of-the-art AI.

Features
Custom GPT Model: Uses a custom GPT model created with OpenAI to simulate various engine parameters and provide optimal tuning advice.
ECU Map Enhancement: Automatically adjusts ECU maps to improve performance and efficiency based on the insights generated by the GPT model.
Customizable Tuning Profiles: Users can create and apply custom tuning profiles to meet specific vehicle requirements.
Real-time Monitoring: Track and analyze engine performance metrics in real-time during the tuning process.
API Integration: The tuning advice and map enhancements are delivered through a web server API for seamless integration.
Web-Based Access: Accessible directly through your web browser, with no need for downloads or installations.
